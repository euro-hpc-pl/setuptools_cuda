# setuptools-cuda

The `setuptools-cuda` is a [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/) 
plugin for building CUDA enabled Python extension modules.


The `setuptools-cuda` is intended for creators of extension modules 
who would like to include, along their C/C++ code, a CUDA code. If you are 
instead looking for more high-level ways of using CUDA from Python, you 
should instead take a look at other packages.

## Getting started

We recommend you start by taking a look at the examples. After 
that, you can either experiment on your own, on read the detailed manual.
